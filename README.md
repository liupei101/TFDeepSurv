# TFDeepSurv
Deep Cox proportional risk model and survival analysis implemented by tensorflow.

The suggested TensorFlow version is 1.15.3. And module testing was passed under TensorFlow-1.15.3.

**NOTE:** [tfdeepsurv-v2.1.0](https://github.com/liupei101/TFDeepSurv/releases) has been released. The old version is on branch `archive_v1`. Compared with version `v1.0`, current version largely improved:
- speed on building computational graph
- utilizing raw tensorflow ops to compute loss function (for handling ties)
- unified format of survival data
- code elegance and simplicity

Read FAQ below firstly if you have problems or directly send an email to me.

## 1. Differences from DeepSurv
[DeepSurv](https://github.com/jaredleekatzman/DeepSurv), a package of Deep Cox proportional risk model, is open-source on Github. But our works may shine in:

- Supporting ties of death time in your survival data, which means different loss function and estimator of survival function (`Breslow` approximation).
- Providing survival function estimation.
- Tuning hyperparameters of DNN using a scientific method - Bayesian Hyperparameters Optimization.
- Implementing by the popular deep learning framework - tensorflow

## 3. Installation
### From source

Download TFDeepSurv package and install from the directory (**Python version >= 3.5**):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/liupei101/TFDeepSurv.git
cd TFDeepSurv
pip install .
```

## 4. Get it started:

### 4.1 Runing with simulated data

Read [Notebook - tfdeepsurv_data_simulated.ipynb](examples/tfdeepsurv_data_simulated.ipynb) for more details!

#### 4.1.1 prepare datasets
```python
from tfdeepsurv.datasets import load_simulated_data

### generate simulated data (Pandas.DataFrame)
# data configuration: 
#     hazard ratio = 2000
#     number of features = 10
#     number of valid features = 2

# No. of training data = 2000
train_data = load_simulated_data(2000, N=2000, num_var=2, num_features=10, seed=1)
# No. of training data = 800
test_data = load_simulated_data(2000, N=800, num_var=2, num_features=10, seed=1)
```

#### 4.1.2 obtain statistics of survival dataset
```python
from tfdeepsurv.datasets import survival_stats

survival_stats(train_data, t_col="t", e_col="e", plot=True)
```

result :
```txt
--------------- Survival Data Statistics ---------------
# Rows: 2000
# Columns: 10 + e + t
# Event Percentage: 74.00%
# Min Time: 0.0001404392
# Max Time: 15.0
```

#### 4.1.3 transfrom survival data

The transformed survival data includes the existing covariates and a new label column. In the new label column, a negative value indicates that this one is a right-censored sample, and a positive value indicates an event occurrence. The new label column 'Y' is simply generated from the time and event columns according to the below equation. 

```
Y =  time, if event = 1
Y = -time, if event = 0
```

**NOTE**: In the latest version 2.1, survival data must be transformed via `tfdeepsurv.datasets.survival_df`.

```python
from tfdeepsurv.datasets import survival_df

surv_train = survival_df(train_data, t_col="t", e_col="e", label_col="Y")
surv_test = survival_df(test_data, t_col="t", e_col="e", label_col="Y")

# columns 't' and 'e' are packed into an new column 'Y'
```

#### 4.1.4 initialize your neural network
```python
from tfdeepsurv import dsnn

input_nodes = len(surv_train.columns) - 1
hidden_layers_nodes = [6, 3, 1]

# the arguments of dsnn can be obtained by Bayesian Hyperparameters Tuning
nn_config = {
    "learning_rate": 0.7,
    "learning_rate_decay": 1.0,
    "activation": 'relu', 
    "L1_reg": 3.4e-5, 
    "L2_reg": 8.8e-5, 
    "optimizer": 'sgd',
    "dropout_keep_prob": 1.0,
    "seed": 1
}
# ESSENTIAL STEP: Pass arguments
model = dsnn(
    input_nodes, 
    hidden_layers_nodes,
    nn_config
)

# ESSENTIAL STEP: Build Computation Graph
model.build_graph()
```

#### 4.1.5 train your neural network model

```python
Y_col = ["Y"]
X_cols = [c for c in surv_train.columns if c not in Y_col]

# model saving and loading is also supported!
# read comments of `train()` function if necessary.
watch_list = model.train(
    surv_train[X_cols], surv_train[Y_col],
    num_steps=1900,
    num_skip_steps=100,
    plot=True
)
```

result :
```
Average loss at step 100: 7.07983
Average loss at step 200: 7.07982
Average loss at step 300: 7.07981
...
Average loss at step 1700: 6.29165
Average loss at step 1800: 6.29007
Average loss at step 1900: 6.28687
```

:-------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------:
![loss curve](tools/README-loss.png)|![ci curve](tools/README-ci.png)

#### 4.1.6 evaluate model performance
```python
print("CI on training data:", model.evals(surv_train[X_cols], surv_train[Y_col]))
print("CI on test data:", model.evals(surv_test[X_cols], surv_test[Y_col]))
```

result :
```txt
CI on training data: 0.8193206851448683
CI on test data: 0.8175830825866967
```

#### 4.1.7 Model prediction

Model prediction includes:
- predicting hazard ratio or log hazard ratio
- predicting survival function

```python
# predict log hazard ratio
print(model.predict(surv_test.loc[0:4, X_cols]))
# predict hazard ratio
print(model.predict(surv_test.loc[0:4, X_cols], output_margin=False))

```
result:
```txt
[[4.629786 ]
 [4.8222055]
 [0.       ]
 [1.4019105]
 [0.       ]]

[[102.49213 ]
 [124.2388  ]
 [  1.      ]
 [  4.062955]
 [  1.      ]]
```

```python
# predict survival function
model.predict_survival_function(surv_test.loc[0:4, X_cols], plot=True)
```
result:

### 4.2 Runing with real-world data
The procedure on real-world data is similar with the described on simulated data. One we need to notice is data preparation.

More details can refer to [Notebook - tfdeepsurv_data_real.ipynb](examples/tfdeepsurv_data_real.ipynb).

## 5. More properties
We provide tools for hyperparameters tuning (Bayesian Hyperparameters Optimization) in deep neural network, which is automatic in searching optimal hyperparameters of DNN.

For more usage of Bayesian Hyperparameters Optimization, you can refer to [here](bysopt/README.md)

## 6. TODO List
Points needed to do in future version `v2.1.0`:
- requirements statement
- dockerfile and docker images of tfdeepsurv
- Github packge tools

## FAQ

update at any time.

**Q1.** How to install this package ?

> You can download or clone the latest package, and then install it using pip tools. TensorFlow would be installed as well. The version of TensorFlow requires `>=1.14.0, <2.0.0` as specified in `setup.py`.

**Q2.** My loss function curve could not converge, why?

> First of all, you can refer to [Notebook - tfdeepsurv_data_real.ipynb](examples/tfdeepsurv_data_real.ipynb) to understand the modeling procedure. Then, you can check the following items one by one: [1]. Whether your suvival data satisfies the requirement. Your original data must include covariates, time and event. And then it must be transformed as introduced in [Notebook - tfdeepsurv_data_real.ipynb](examples/tfdeepsurv_data_real.ipynb). [2]. Data normalization. The covariates should be normalized to the same magnitude if you want to get a quick convergence. [3]. Learning rate setting. It is better to set a relatively lower learning rate, such as 0.01.
